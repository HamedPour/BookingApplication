# A Dive Into the Deep

---

First a **massive** apology to any fellow web developer that wonders through this repository. The code is fairly bad as the repo is only meant as a testing ground.

It is an attempt at fiddling around with React, Express, and Postgresql and to hopefully learn better by building and struggling. Doing more of the latter of course.

## The Challenges...

First is to not use ORMs and instead manually design, build the database and manage every db query myself forcing me to work more closely with the database. I have discovered that I greatly enjoy this part. Writing and learning sql is fairly fun _(who would have thought!)_

Second is to force myself to use React instead of Vue. I have never really found React to be an intuitive framework compared to Vue. This challenge has been fairly painful so far hehehe

1. Finally, third to actually write some backend code. I had not till now truly appreciated how much work is required in setting up a proper GRUD backend system. Regardless of the headaches and rages it has been a rewarding experience.
